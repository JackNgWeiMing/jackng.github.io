					In current day it's quite common for each of us having our own computer. But when i was in my 13th, 
					there was only one desktop in my family and we( 4 of my a brother and sisters) need to shared using it. 
					I don't really know computer at the time as my brother and i usually used it for entertainment or watch drama/anime.
