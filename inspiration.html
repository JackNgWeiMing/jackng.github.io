				<h2> Abraham Lincoln</h2>
				<p class="hidden">
				 Abraham Lincoln not only the one of greatest president on the world but also a wise and good speaker.
				 The first time i know him is in a lesson in about <em>Gettysburg Address</em>.
				 His speech is brief but enough to show " All Men Are Created Equal" and redefine Battle of Gettysburg as "new born of freedom ".
